# Chowgoo - Food Delivery Platform Case Study

## Project Overview

Developed a full-stack food delivery platform focusing on speed, efficiency, and user experience. The platform incorporates machine learning for delivery optimization and seamless order management.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

-   React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering
-   Tailwind CSS for responsive design
-   Redux for state management
-   Material-UI components for consistent UI elements

### Backend

-   Node.js/Express.js RESTful API
-   MongoDB for database management
-   JWT authentication
-   Socket.IO for real-time order tracking

### Key Features

-   ML-powered delivery time prediction
-   Real-time order tracking
-   User authentication and profile management
-   Restaurant partner dashboard
-   Payment gateway integration
-   Admin dashboard for analytics

## Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Order Tracking

**Solution:** Implemented Socket.IO for bi-directional communication between servers and clients, enabling live tracking updates with minimal latency.

### Challenge 2: Delivery Time Optimization

**Solution:** Developed a machine learning model using historical delivery data to predict accurate delivery times considering factors like traffic, distance, and order volume.

### Challenge 3: Scale & Performance

**Solution:**

-   Implemented Redis caching
-   Used AWS CloudFront for CDN
-   Optimized database queries with indexing
-   Containerized deployment with Docker

## Performance Metrics
